# Odin-Landing-Page
The landing page project for The Odin Project. I chose to model it after a fake math tutoring service. It was useful practice for placing HTML elements with FlexBox and then styling them with CSS. Learned some useful CSS properties along the way such as border radius and cursor.

The quote is misattributed to Einstein as a joke. The quote is actually from William Paul Thurston.
